# TorMod

TorMod is a Minecraft Fabric mod that allows you to play Minecraft while routing your traffic through the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/). This mod automatically installs and runs Tor in the background, providing enhanced privacy and anonymity while playing Minecraft. However, please note that using Tor with Minecraft is easily detectable and **may result in bans on certain servers**. Use this mod at your own risk.

## Features
- **Automatic Tor Installation**: The mod downloads and installs the Tor expert bundle for your platform (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
- **Customizable Tor Port**: Configure Tor to use a custom port (e.g., 1337) instead of the default 9050.
- **Seamless Integration**: Tor runs in the background while you play Minecraft, routing all mc network traffic through the Tor network.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Easy to Use**: No manual configuration requiredâ€”just install the mod and play.
